Loremaster's primary objective is to provide fans of tabletop role-playing games, such as Dungeons and Dragons, a way to store and organize their data for the games. This software is used as a way for people to store and create their characters, locations, familiars, guilds, inventories, and locations. 

Users register for accounts by entering an email and password. Users can interact with other user's characters, as long as those characters have a public visibility. There are also user permissions, as some users have elevated status as admins. As an admin a user can search through all characters and delete characters and even ban users if it is needed.

After an account is created users can update their information such as username, password and email from the user settings screen.

Before using the site, users will be required to register for an account, this way all of their creations can be linked to them. Users can insert pictures for each of the
available fields so they are able to accurately depict what they look like (it is required to do this before creation of the item/character). A character will have several 
features such as traits, name, stats and can also be asigned to an already created familar, guild, location or relationship with another character. On the character screen
connected locations, guilds, or familars can be found and will redirect to their own page.Familars are very similar to characters as they will have traits and stats. Users
will also be able to add a visability feature for being private or public to deterimine who will be able to view their character. Other users can also be added on as editors
for any of the mentioned objects.

Characters can also be added to a guild, with this different characters from different users are connected and users can find other guild members easily.

When creating a location, pictures can also be added and child locations can be added to show a location within an location.

A character can be assigned several familars which will also have traits, stats, and inventories.

Items and Inventories can be created with a name, image and description. Inventories can be assigned to a character, and within the inventory several items can be added, and
these amounts can be quickly changed while editing.
