Loremaster's primary objective is to provide fans of tabletop role-playing games, such as Dungeons and Dragons, a way to store and organize their data for the games. This software is used as a way for people to store and create their characters, locations, familiars, guilds, inventories, and locations. 

Users register for accounts by entering an email and password. Users can interact with other user's characters, as long as those characters have a public visibility. There are also user permissions, as some users have elevated status as admins. As an admin a user can search through all characters and delete characters and even ban users if it is needed.

After an account is created users can update their information such as username, password and email from the user settings screen.

Before using the site, users will be required to register for an account, this way all of their creations can be linked to them. Users can insert pictures for each of the
available fields so they are able to accurately depict what they look like (it is required to do this before creation of the item/character). A character will have several 
features such as traits, name, stats and can also be asigned to an already created familar, guild, location or relationship with another character. On the character screen, you 
can easily click on the connected location, guild, or familar to view their page.Users will also be able to add a visability feature for being private or public to deterimine 
who will be able to view their character. Other users can also be added on as editors.

When creating a location, pictures can also be added and child locations can be added to show a location within an location.

A character can be assigned several familars which will also have traits, stats, and inventories.

Items can be created with a name, image and description and these can also have editor permissions so different users can change it.

Inventories can be assigned to a character, and within the inventory several items can be added, and these amounts can be quickly changed while editing.
