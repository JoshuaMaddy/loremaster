Loremaster's primary objective is to provide fans of tabletop role-playing games, such as Dungeons and Dragons, a way to store and organize their data for the games. This software is used as a way for people to store and create their characters, locations, familiars, guilds, inventories, and locations. Each character that is created can have locations, stats, traits, items, familiars, inventories, visibilities, and relationships with other characters. 

Users register for accounts by entering an email and password. Users can interact with other user's characters, as long as those characters have a public visibility. There are also user permissions, as some users have elevated status as admins.
