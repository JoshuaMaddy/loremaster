For task 4, we created a simple ASP.NET web application.

This demo version of "Loremaster" contains the following details:
- Login system that redirects users who aren't logged in.
- Database that contains user information.
- The ability to create, edit, and delete character sheets.
- The ability to make your character either publically viewable or hidden from browsing.

The main feature is the "characters" page, which displays all public characters, as well
as any characters owned by the login information. Information is accessed from the database
to display details about the character, such as their class, race, level, and owner.

If you are the owner of a character, you can edit or delete it, causing the details to be 
updated in the database, and these changes will be visible to everyone if it is public.

The version of "Loremaster" developed for this task is somewhat simplistic. This is due
to our actual development environment being made in python. In the python version, we have
more advanced features, such as a search bar, ability to upload images, etc. For the ASP.NET
version, we just included the core login and character creation features, since the release
is going to be with python, so any features developed in ASP.NET would only be for task 4
and would not contribute to the final project.

Please let us know if you have any questions or difficulties loading the application.
